# Working Desk 

An easy to build working desk, without using srews, made with 9mm plywood (also the uploaded files a prepared for 9mm material)

From Gder: I have redrawn the desk for 1/2" plywood and corrected many vector errors. I also generated the GCode to cut all parts from one sheet. The code will cut the slots first then the profiles. Tabs have been inserted to kept the boards inplace while cutting. Use 1/4" two flute router bit and chomp away!
